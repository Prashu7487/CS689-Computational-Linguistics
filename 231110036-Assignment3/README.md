## This is readme file for Assignment 3 of the course CS689

## Important Note:

-> I have created these notebooks on the kaggle so paths of files are defined for that, however I have always maintiained a path variable wich you can change to empty string ("") and keep all the files in same directory.
-> the .txt files that are in submission folder are dumped by 2nd notebook, so these files may be not related much to first notebook due to random sampling


## These are the steps to follow and some requirements for the notebook submitted.

-> there are 2 notebooks (1 for NLLB and IndicTrans model "231110036-Assignment3_NLLB_IndicTrans_notebook.ipynb" and the other one for ChatGPT "231110036-Assignment3_ChatGPT_notebook.ipynb")
-> In each notebook, required comments are mentioned in the markdown cell
-> the test data is sampled randomly to 1000 sentences, so each time you run the test results may slightly vary
-> Answer of question 3 is given in the ChatGPT notebook itself in a markdown cell.


## Requirements

-> all the data files should be in the same directory for each notebook
(In my code that is Kaggle input directory for NLLB and IndicTrans notebook all files are in "/kaggle/input/test-data/" and for the notebook of chatGPT model all the data files are in path '/kaggle/input/textdata/')

-> all files that are generated during execution are generated in the same directory (In output directory in kaggle)
-> the hi,eng, and mr test files are required (from the mentioned dataset) to run submitted notebooks, also the chatgpt code requires ChatGPT translated files too.

-> some codes to write the files are commented, uncomment if you need
